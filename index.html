            <p style="margin: 25px;">Hi there, my name is Denise and I am a research coordinator in the Department of Psychology who is fascinated with web development, culminating in my attendence in this bootcamp!
                I originally found my passion for clinical psychology through volunteering for a rape crisis center where I visited survivors of rape trauma in the emergency rooms around Chicago.
                Through my clinical experience, I demonstrated the responsibility to work with patients at a clinic that provided Intensive Outpatient Treatment to veterans suffering from Posttraumatic Stress and Moral Injury.
                After working at the hospital, I transitioned to a full time job managing a lab that studies young people at risk for thought disorder and schizophrenia. I feel passionate about helping people in harm's way, 
                and I hope I can continue my research in graduate school one day.
                <br> <br> <br>
                    Through this bootcamp, I intend to design my own computerized tasks to use in research. Potentially, computerized tasks would be able to detect early onset risk factors for psychosis that could be implemented in a clinical setting. 
                    Reasons for supporting early onset detection would be to lower the incidence rates of schizophrenia in the community and to lessen the cost to society (homelessness, public aid, etc.). 
                    
                    Let's look at what I've done so far!</p>
